# APIs

* Today In History  (http://history.muffinlabs.com)
  * History item model: information, year, array of links
  * Link model: subject, title, link
* Wikipedia         (https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)
  * Only needed for article thumbnail

### Possible Extra APIs

* Numbers API       (http://numbersapi.com)
  * Only returns text
* Twitter API       (https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public)
  * Twitter API helper class

# Considerations

### Pitch

* We want to give the user perspective on history with a device that they use every day to provide daily information.

### Stakeholders

* Any iOS user could use this app to learn about important events and people in history. With information about each day, there are fewer events to be overwhelmed by and provide a reason to come back every day.

### Core Flows

* Key functions: Present information about what has happened each day in history.
* Screens: Main screen with one sample event, birth, and death for that day. After clicking on any of the three objects, present a TableView with more information of that type. Each item will have links to Wikipedia which can be opened in a Safari view controller to get more in-depth information.

### Final Demo

* Show the home page which shows an a few event examples for that day.
* Open one of the event lists
  * Scroll through the events provided by the API.
  * Open a Wikipedia article from the events.
  * (optional item) Show a map view where the event took place.
  * (optional item) Tweet one of the events.
* Return to the main page and start changing the current date
  * Swipe left and right to change the selected date.
  * Open the calendar to pick a different date further away.
  * Tap the 'today' button to return to the current date.
* Go to settings
  * (optional item) Change the app's color scheme.
  * Open acknowledgements page
  * (optional item) Show notification settings.
* (optional items) Go to the device settings and change the date.
  * Receive a notification and go to the app.


### Mobile Features

* Optional daily notifications of events.
* Some Wikipedia articles have coordinates available which could be shown on a map.

### Technical Concerns

* Using the Wikipedia API to get the article coordinates.
* User selected color schemes could be at least tedious to set up.
* Need to figure out how notifications work.
